# Reorder List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reorder the list as if it were folded on itself. For example, if the list is represented as follows:

```text
L(0) -> L(1) -> L(2) -> ... -> L(n-2) -> L(n-1) -> L(n)

will change to

L(0) -> L(n) -> L(1) -> L(n-1) -> L(2) -> L(n-2) ... 
```

You don’t need to modify the values in the list’s nodes; only the links between nodes need to be changed.
