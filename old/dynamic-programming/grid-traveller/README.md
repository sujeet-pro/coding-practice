# Grid Traveller

Say that you are a traveller on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner. You may only move down or right.

In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with dimensions `m * n`?

Write a function `gridTraveller(m: int, n: int) -> int` that calculates this.

- Minimum Valid Grid: 1x1
- Invalid Grids: 0x0, 0x1, 1x0
