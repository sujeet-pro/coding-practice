## Can Sum

Write a function `canSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to generate the targetSum using numbers from the array.

You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.

You may assume that all input numbers are nonnegative.

## How Sum

Write a function `howSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return an array containing any combination of elements that add up to exactly the targetSum. If there is no combination that adds up to the targetSum, then return null.

If there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any single one.

## Best Sum

Write a function `bestSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return an array containing the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum.

If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.
