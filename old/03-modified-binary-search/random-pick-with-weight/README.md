# Random Pick With Weight

Youâ€™re given an array of positive integers, `weights`, where `weights[i]` is the weight of the `i`th index.

Write a function, `PickIndex()`, which performs weighted random selection to return an index from the weights array. The larger the value of weights[i], the heavier the weight is, and the higher the chances of its index being picked.
